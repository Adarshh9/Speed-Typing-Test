# Typing Speed Test

This is a Python script that tests your typing speed. It generates a random sentence and prompts you to type it as accurately and quickly as possible. The script will then analyze your typing speed and accuracy based on the time taken to complete the typing task and the correctness of your input.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `wonderwords` library to generate a random sentence.
2. It uses the `colorama` library to add color to the output, highlighting correct and incorrect characters.
3. The user is prompted to start typing the generated sentence.
4. The script records the start time and end time of typing to calculate the time taken.
5. The input characters are displayed with color, indicating correct and incorrect input.
6. Typing speed is calculated in terms of words per minute (WPM) based on the time taken to type the sentence and the length of the sentence.
7. The script provides feedback on typing speed and accuracy.

## How to Run

To run this typing speed test script, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install wonderwords colorama`.
2. Save the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `typing_speed_test.py`).
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `typing_speed_test.py`.
4. Run the script by executing: `python typing_speed_test.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to start typing the generated sentence.
6. After typing, the script will display your typing speed (WPM) and provide feedback on accuracy.

Please note that the script may require you to press "Enter" to start typing and may not handle some edge cases. You can modify the script to add more functionality or error handling as needed.
